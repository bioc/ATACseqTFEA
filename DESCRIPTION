Description: Assay for Transpose-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq)
    is a technique to assess genome-wide chromatin accessibility by probing open
    chromatin with hyperactive mutatnt Tn5 Transposase that inserts sequencing
    adaters into open regions of the genome. ATACseqTFEA is a improvement of 
    current computational method that detects differential activity of 
    transcription factors (TFs). ATACseqTFEA not only use the difference of 
    open region informations, but also (or more emphersize) the difference of
    TFs footprints.ATACseqTFEA provides an easy, rigorous way to broadly asess
    TF activity changes between two conditions.
